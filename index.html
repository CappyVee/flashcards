      <ul>
        <li class="js"><span class="fc">JavaScript (JS):</span><span class="jsfc">JavaScriptÂ® (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well. It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.</span> </li>
        <br>
        <li class="op"><span class="fc">Operators:</span><span class="opfc">Programming languages typically support a set of operators: constructs which behave generally like functions, but which differ syntactically or semantically from usual functions. Common simple examples include arithmetic (addition with +), comparison (with >), and logical operations (such as AND or &&). More involved examples include assignment (usually = or :=), field access in a record or object (usually .), and the scope resolution operator (often ::). Languages usually define a set of built-in operators, and in some cases allow user-defined operators.</span> </li>
        <br>
        <li class="var"><span class="fc">Variables:</span><span class="varfc">In computer programming, a variable or scalar is a storage location paired with an associated symbolic name (an identifier), which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value. The variable name is the usual way to reference the stored value; this separation of name and content allows the name to be used independently of the exact information it represents. The identifier in computer source code can be bound to a value during run time, and the value of the variable may thus change during the course of program execution.</span> </li>
        <br>
        <li class="vn"><span class="fc">Variable Naming Conventions:</span><span class="vnfc">use "var" to assign variable, use camelCase naming conventions.</span></li>
        <br>
        <li class="fun"><span class="fc">Functions:</span><span class="funfc">a function is a sequence of program instructions that perform a specific task, packaged as a unit. This unit can then be used in programs wherever that particular task should be performed.</span> </li>
        <br>
        <li class="met"><span class="fc">Methods:</span><span class="metfc">A method in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a procedure associated with a message and an object. An object is mostly made up of data and behavior, which form the interface that an object presents to the outside world. Data is represented as properties of the object and behavior as methods. For example, a Window object would have methods such as open and close, while its state (whether it is opened or closed) would be a property.</span> </li>
        <br>
        <li class="arg"><span class="fc">Arguments:</span><span class="argfc">In programming, a value that is passed between programs, subroutines or functions. Arguments are independent items, or variables, that contain data or codes. </span> </li>
        <br>
        <li class="par"><span class="fc">Parameters:</span><span class="parfc">When an argument is used to customize a program for a user, it is typically called a "parameter."</span> </li>
        <br>
        <li class="ret"><span class="fc">Return:</span><span class="retfc">a return statement causes execution to leave the current subroutine and resume at the point in the code immediately after where the subroutine was called, known as its return address.</span> </li>
        <br>
        <li class="cm"><span class="fc">Chaining Methods:</span><span class="cmfc">Method chaining, also known as named parameter idiom, is a common syntax for invoking multiple method calls in object-oriented programming languages. Each method returns an object, allowing the calls to be chained together in a single statement without requiring variables to store the intermediate results.</span> </li>
        <br>
        <li class="str"><span class="fc">Strings:</span><span class="strfc">a string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable. The latter may allow its elements to be mutated and the length changed, or it may be fixed (after creation).</span> </li>
        <br>
        <li class="boo"><span class="fc">Booleans:</span><span class="boofc">he Boolean data type is a data type, having two values (usually denoted true and false), intended to represent the truth values of logic and Boolean algebra. </span> </li>
        <br>
        <li class="un"><span class="fc">Undefined:</span><span class="unfc"> undefined value is a condition where an expression does not have a correct value, although it is syntactically correct. An undefined value must not be confused with empty string, boolean "false" or other "empty" (but defined) values.</span> </li>
        <br>
        <li class="nan"><span class="fc">NaN:</span><span class="nanfc">NaN, standing for not a number, is a numeric data type value representing an undefined or unrepresentable value, especially in floating-point calculations. </span> </li>
        <br>
        <li class="esc"><span class="fc">Escape:</span><span class="escfc">Character combinations consisting of a backslash (\) followed by a letter or by a combination of digits are called "escape sequences." To represent a newline character, single quotation mark, or certain other characters in a character constant, you must use escape sequences. An escape sequence is regarded as a single character and is therefore valid as a character constant.</span> </li>
        <br>
        <li class="alt"><span class="fc">Alert:</span><span class="altfc">The alert() method displays an alert box with a specified message and an OK button. An alert box is often used if you want to make sure information comes through to the user.</span></li>
        <br>
        <li class="com"><span class="fc">Comments:</span><span class="comfc">a comment is a programmer-readable explanation or annotation in the source code of a computer program. They are added with the purpose of making the source code easier for humans to understand, and are generally ignored by compilers and interpreters.</span> </li>
        <br>
        <li class="jqu"><span class="fc">jQuery:</span><span class="jqufc">jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.</span> </li>
        <br>
        <li class="att"><span class="fc">Attributes:</span><span class="attfc">In computing, an attribute is a specification that defines a property of an object, element, or file. It may also refer to or set the specific value for a given instance of such.</span> </li>
